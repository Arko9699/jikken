Overengineered Hardwired Keyboard by yours truly. With inspiration from various other keyboards, I present my own (attempt at) fully 3DP mechanical keyboard.

# BoM

1.1x Waveshare RP2040 Zero (my MCU of choice for this build, you are free to choose your own but you need to edit the Bottom Case)
2.66x MX key switches
3.66x 1N4148 diodes
4.Soldering Tools
5.4x M2x5 Screws
6.7x M2x12 Screws
7.7x M2 threaded inserts (you can try screwing into the bare plastic but its not recommended)

# KMK

Since I'm using a RP2040 MCU I've decided to go with KMK as its simpler to set up than QMK albeit at the cost of potential VIA functionality.
Guide coming soom^TM.
